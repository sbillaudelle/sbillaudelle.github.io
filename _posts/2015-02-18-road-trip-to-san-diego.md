My friend and colleague Paxon was moving to San Francisco. He told me something about driving down there to get some last stuff from his old room and lab. Without thinking, I grabbed my toothbrush and got in the car. At that time, I did not know that I had just started the most beautiful road trip of my life. We followed [California State Route 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Route_1) most of the time until we reached Los Angeles. Since it was getting dark, we decided to take the faster inland highways. Now I'm going to shut up and let you enjoy the pictures I have taken on this trip.
